# Banshee 44 Mods Frontend

![demo](./media/demo.gif)

## What

A single page web app written in React showing Destiny 2 mod data.

## Tech Stack

- React
- AWS S3
- AWS CloudFront

## Status

On hold given Season 14 changes by Bungie with how mods are distributed. I made
a decision to focus on the Twitter bot now with a rebrand and wider scope to add
more value to the community.

Made with :heart:, JavaScript, and GitHub.
